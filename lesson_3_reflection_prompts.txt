When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
    When you are collaborating with others. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository. 

	You might now want things to update because code may break. You dont dont what chages are added.
